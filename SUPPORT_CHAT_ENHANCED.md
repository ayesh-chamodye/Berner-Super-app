## Troubleshooting

### Images not uploading?
**Check:**

2. Bucket is public
3. Storage RLS policies applied
4. Image file exists at path
5. Check console for errors

**Common error:**
```
❌ File does not exist at /path/to/image
```
**Solution:** Image picker returned wrong path

### Thumbnail not showing?
**Check:**
1. File path is correct
2. Image permissions granted
3. File still exists (not deleted by system)

### Full-screen viewer not working?
**Check:**
1. Image URL is valid
2. Network connection
3. Storage bucket is public
4. CORS enabled

### Ticket list empty?
**Check:**
1. User is authenticated
2. RLS policies allow SELECT
3. Tickets exist in database
4. Refresh the list

## Performance Tips

### Image Optimization
```dart
final XFile? image = await _imagePicker.pickImage(
  source: ImageSource.gallery,
  maxWidth: 1920,      // Resize to max 1920px
  maxHeight: 1920,     // Resize to max 1920px
  imageQuality: 85,    // Compress to 85%
);
```

### Lazy Loading Messages
For tickets with 100+ messages:
```dart
final messages = await SupabaseService.getTicketMessages(
  ticketId,
  limit: 50,  // Load only last 50
);
```

### Cache Images
Consider adding cached_network_image package:
```dart
CachedNetworkImage(
  imageUrl: imageUrl,
  placeholder: (context, url) => CircularProgressIndicator(),
  errorWidget: (context, url, error) => Icon(Icons.error),
)
```
