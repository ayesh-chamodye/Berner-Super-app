# Profile Picture Upload to Supabase Storage - COMPLETE ‚úÖ

## Summary
Profile pictures are now uploaded to **Supabase Storage** instead of being stored locally.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Upload/Delete Functions ‚úÖ
**File:** `lib/services/supabase_service.dart`

```dart
// Upload profile picture to Supabase Storage
static Future<String?> uploadProfilePicture(String filePath, String userId)

// Delete profile picture from Supabase Storage
static Future<bool> deleteProfilePicture(String userId)
```

### 2. Updated Profile Page ‚úÖ
**File:** `lib/screens/profile_page.dart`

- Uploads selected image to Supabase Storage
- Gets public URL from upload
- Saves URL to database
- Displays image from URL (NetworkImage) or local file (FileImage)

### 3. Updated Profile Setup Page ‚úÖ
**File:** `lib/screens/auth/profile_setup_page.dart`

- Uploads profile picture during registration
- Saves public URL to database
- Handles upload failures gracefully

### 4. Updated Display Logic ‚úÖ
Images are now displayed using:
- **NetworkImage** - If URL starts with `http` (Supabase Storage)
- **FileImage** - If URL is a local file path (fallback)
- **Icon** - If no picture is set

## How It Works

### Upload Flow
```
1. User selects image from gallery/camera
   ‚Üì
2. Image path stored in memory (_selectedImage)
   ‚Üì
3. User clicks Save
   ‚Üì
4. SupabaseService.uploadProfilePicture() is called
   ‚Üì
5. File is read as bytes
   ‚Üì
6. Uploaded to Supabase Storage bucket: 'profile-pictures'
   ‚Üì
7. Public URL is returned
   ‚Üì
8. URL is saved to user_profiles.profile_picture_url
   ‚Üì
9. Image displays from Supabase Storage
```

### File Storage
- **Bucket name**: `profile-pictures`
- **File path**: `profile_pictures/profile_{userId}.{extension}`
- **Public URL**: `https://ompqyjdrfnjdxqavslhg.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/profile-pictures/profile_pictures/profile_5.jpg`
- **Upsert**: Enabled (overwrites old image)

## Setup Required

### ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Create Storage Bucket

You **MUST** create the storage bucket in Supabase before this will work.

Follow instructions in: [SETUP_STORAGE_BUCKET.md](database/SETUP_STORAGE_BUCKET.md)

**Quick Setup:**
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Storage
2. Create bucket named: `profile-pictures`
3. Make it **Public**
4. Add RLS policies for anon/authenticated users

## Testing

### Test Upload
1. Run app
2. Go to Profile page
3. Click Edit
4. Tap profile picture
5. Select image
6. Click Save (checkmark icon)
7. Watch logs for:
   ```
   üîµ ProfilePage: Uploading profile picture to Supabase...
   üîµ SupabaseService: Uploading profile picture for user 5
   üü¢ SupabaseService: Profile picture uploaded successfully
   üü¢ SupabaseService: Public URL: https://...
   üü¢ ProfilePage: Profile picture uploaded successfully
   ```

### Verify in Supabase
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard
2. Storage ‚Üí profile-pictures bucket
3. Check `profile_pictures` folder
4. You should see `profile_{userId}.jpg/png`

### Verify in App
1. Close and reopen app
2. Navigate to Profile page
3. Profile picture should load from Supabase
4. Network indicator should show (proves it's loading from internet)

## Error Handling

### Upload Fails
- Fallback to local file path
- Warning logged
- User can still save profile
- Profile picture stored locally

### Display Fails
- Shows default person icon
- No crash
- Graceful degradation

## File Locations

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `lib/services/supabase_service.dart` | Added `uploadProfilePicture()`, `deleteProfilePicture()` |
| `lib/screens/profile_page.dart` | Upload on save, display NetworkImage |
| `lib/screens/auth/profile_setup_page.dart` | Upload during registration |
| `database/SETUP_STORAGE_BUCKET.md` | Setup instructions |

## Database Schema

### user_profiles table
```sql
profile_picture_url TEXT  -- Stores EITHER:
                          -- 1. Supabase Storage public URL (https://...)
                          -- 2. Local file path (fallback)
```

## Security Notes

### Current Setup (Development)
- ‚úÖ Anonymous users can upload
- ‚úÖ Public can view
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Anyone can delete/update

### Production Recommendations
1. Restrict upload to authenticated users only
2. Users can only update their own pictures
3. Add file size limits (5MB)
4. Add rate limiting
5. Scan uploads for malicious content
6. Implement image optimization

## Next Steps

### Required (Before Production)
- [ ] Create `profile-pictures` bucket in Supabase
- [ ] Set up RLS policies
- [ ] Test upload/download
- [ ] Verify images display correctly

### Optional Enhancements
- [ ] Add image cropping before upload
- [ ] Compress images more aggressively
- [ ] Add loading indicator during upload
- [ ] Show upload progress percentage
- [ ] Allow multiple profile pictures (gallery)
- [ ] Add image filters/effects
- [ ] Cache images locally for offline viewing
- [ ] Implement CDN for faster loading

## Troubleshooting

### "Bucket not found" error
- Create the `profile-pictures` bucket in Supabase Dashboard
- Make sure name is exactly `profile-pictures` (with hyphen)

### "Permission denied" error
- Check RLS policies allow anon role
- Verify bucket is set to Public

### Images not loading
- Check internet connection
- Verify URL in database is correct
- Check browser console for CORS errors
- Ensure Supabase project is not paused

### Upload timeout
- Check file size (should be < 5MB)
- Check internet speed
- Try smaller image

## Benefits

### Before (Local Storage)
- ‚ùå Images lost when app reinstalled
- ‚ùå Not accessible from multiple devices
- ‚ùå No backup
- ‚ùå Takes up device storage

### After (Supabase Storage)
- ‚úÖ Images persist across devices
- ‚úÖ Automatic backup
- ‚úÖ Public URL (can share)
- ‚úÖ Centralized storage
- ‚úÖ Accessible from web/other apps
- ‚úÖ CDN-ready for fast loading

## Cost Estimate

Supabase Free Tier:
- **Storage**: 1GB free
- **Bandwidth**: 2GB/month free
