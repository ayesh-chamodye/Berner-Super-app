## 🔑 Configuration Required

### Before First Run:

   - Run `database/COMPLETE_SCHEMA.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor
   - Run `database/02_helper_functions.sql`
   - Run `database/04_advanced_functions.sql`
   - Verify `.env` has correct credentials

2. **text.lk API** (required for OTP)
   - Ensure `.env` has valid `TEXTLK_API_TOKEN`
   - Verify `TEXTLK_API_URL` is correct

## 📝 Print Statements (Debugging)

The 93 print statement warnings are **intentional** for debugging:

```dart
print('🔵 Starting operation...');  // Info
print('🟢 Success!');                // Success
print('❌ Error occurred');          // Error
print('⚠️ Warning');                 // Warning
```

These help track the flow during development and can be removed in production by:

```bash
# Remove all debug prints for production build
flutter build apk --release
```

---

## 🚀 Next Steps
